Hi, I’m Ali!

I'm a designer based in Sweden, and my specialties are gameplay design, 3C design, combat design, and technical design. 
My interests in design, however, stretch into many different domains.

Currently, I'm working at a AAA-studio as a 3C designer, and have previously worked at an indie studio primarily working in Unreal Engine, a major UGC studio using several different engines, and a mobile games studio using Unity.

As part of my goal to learn new things, I'm practicing art skills, design skills within architecture and interior designs, and continuing to practice programming with AngelScript and C#. 

For any inquiries, please reach out. Thank you!
